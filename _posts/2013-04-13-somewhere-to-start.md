Here I am. My own small little corner of the internet. A centralized location; a place to call home.

Let me start off with a few formalities. My name is Kyle Niewiada (/kaɪl niː-viː-ɑː-də/). If the phonetic spelling it correct, it should read something very close to _k-eye-l knee-vee-ah-da_. I've been playing the piano for a while now. I enjoy it. This website will hopefully be the center of my online presence.

On this site, I hope to share my latest musical projects/demos, link to a [music store](http://kyleniewiada.bandcamp.com) that offers some of my latest songs for sale, and my blog (found here). I'd like my blog to orient projects of what I am doing and related ideas. I'll probably post about new discoveries and sounds I have made while working with my keyboard.

If you haven't figured it out already, I enjoy writing music and performing it on the piano. This interest has stemmed from an underlying passion towards enjoying the piano. It's slightly hard to explain. Many kids who play piano were forced into that activity from their parents. I was nearly the opposite. I _wanted_ to learn how to play the piano and had to convince my parents to let me take lessons. Looking back, this turned out to be a great decision. I'm nowhere near a professional level of playing (or sight reading) but I thoroughly enjoy <strike>playing alone with a piano</strike> music. I'm sure many can relate to the feeling of being unbothered with their favorite hobby.

The point I'm trying to make is that writing music for the piano is a strong passion for me. I don't need to become a concert pianist or a classical genius to enjoy it. I have found my own way to keep this activity connected into my life. It's an outlet-- a different world. If you take away anything from reading this post, I'd like you to realize that.

The remainder of this blog will be centralized around different projects that I'm working on and discoveries that I would like to share.

This is a start.

Keep listening  
-Kyle
