It has come to my attention that my original blog post outlining the process that I took to dump my Nintendo 64 save files is not too friendly when it comes to reading it as a guide.  originally I was going to edit the post to incorporate the new guide steps, but I realize I was soon losing proper scope of what that original blog post was about; the process I took to recover my save collection. Below are the steps you will want to follow if you would like to back up your save file for the Nintendo 64 game, Zelda The Ocarina of Time.

## Required tools:

- Your favorite Linux distro (live CD is acceptable)
- Nintendo 64
- Zelda Ocarina of Time
- GameShark with a working parallel port
- Computer with a working parallel port
- Parallel port cable (other users were unable to get a USB to parallel port cable to work)
