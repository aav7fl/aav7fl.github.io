Hi, I'm Kyle Niewiada (/kaɪl niː-viː-ɑː-də/). Welcome to my small corner of the internet. You can rearrange the letters in "Kyle Niewiada" to say "I like a new day". In my free time, I used to write music. You can listen to it <a href ="https://kyleniewiada.bandcamp.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

Maybe you've stumbled across this page by accident; perhaps you had full intentions of visiting this page. If you have, thank you! This website is meant to be a host and central hub to my music and various projects. I write for people to enjoy what they read and hear. My hopes are that people will take away more than they came with (maybe even purchase a song or two).

I write blog posts with no schedule and will write them as I carry out projects. I am passionate about music and computers. I enjoy programming and difficult projects do not deter me.

If you'd like to tell me a story, ask questions about my music, or contact me about something else—[drop me a message here](/contact/).

Best Regards,  
Kyle
