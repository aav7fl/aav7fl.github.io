Hi, I'm Kyle Niewiada (/kaɪl niː-viː-ɑː-də/). Welcome to my small corner of the internet.

Maybe you've stumbled across this page by accident, perhaps you had full intentions of visiting this page. If you have, thank you! This website is meant to be a host and central hub to my music and other content. I write my music for you, the listener. My hopes are that people will enjoy what I do, and share it with their friends (maybe even purchase a song or two).

From time to time I will release new songs from here, post about new videos, and occasionally make a blog post. You are most welcome to subscribe your email to very occasional updates and news from me.

I have been playing the instrument known as a piano for many years. Recently in my life, I have begun to work on writing and arranging my own music. My writing tastes usually revolve around the piano (and some synth) with room to change. I have other interests too (e.g. computers) and I may occasionally blog about those interests. If that does not deter you, I hope you enjoy will enjoy listening to my music.

If you'd like to tell me a story, ask questions about my music, or contact me about something else—[drop me a message here](/contact.html).

Best Regards,  
Kyle
