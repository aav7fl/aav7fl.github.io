Hi, I'm Kyle Niewiada (/kaɪl niː-viː-ɑː-də/). Welcome to my small corner of the internet. </p>
<p>Maybe you've stumbled across this page by accident, perhaps you had full intentions of visiting this page. If you have, thank you! This website is meant to be a host and central hub to my music and other content. I write my music for you, the listener. My hopes are that people will enjoy what I do, and share it with their friends (maybe even purchase a song or two). </p>
<p>From time to time I will release new songs from here, post about new videos, and occasionally make a blog post.  You are most welcome to subscribe your email to very occasional updates and news from me.</p>
<p>I have been playing the instrument known as a piano for many years. Recently in my life, I have begun to work on writing and arranging my own music. My writing tastes usually revolve around the piano (and some synth) with room to change. I have other interests too (e.g. computers) and I may occasionally blog about those interests. If that does not deter you, I hope you enjoy will enjoy listening to my music. </p>
<p>If you'd like to tell me a story, ask questions about my music, or contact me about something else—<a href="/contact.html">drop me a message here</a>.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Kyle</p>
